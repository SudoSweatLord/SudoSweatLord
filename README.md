# Hi, I'm K. Kevin ðŸ‘‹

<p>Former psychology enthusiast turned web developer. My background in psychology gives me a unique insight into user experience and effective problem-solving. When completing a web development bootcamp, I built my own Same Game using React, which fueled my passion for creating interactive web applications.

I enjoy working with JavaScript, Linux, GitHub, and React, and I'm excited to expand my skills into backend development. Currently, I'm diving into Python to enhance my abilities in web scraping and machine learning.

I believe that with the right resources, no problem is insurmountable. I'm actively working on building my own SaaS and am eager to collaborate on innovative projects.
